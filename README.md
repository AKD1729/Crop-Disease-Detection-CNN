## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a unified 10-class CNN classifier trained on **~7,700 images** to identify healthy plants and critical foliar diseases. The CNN architecture is deliberately built and trained from scratch rather than leveraging pre-trained weights (Transfer Learning) to explore neural representation learning and inductive biases directly.

### Targeted Classes (10 Total)

| Crop | Disease / Condition | Source Dataset | Image Count |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Corn (Maize)** | Cercospora / Gray Leaf Spot | Raw PlantVillage | 513 |
| **Corn (Maize)** | Common Rust | Raw PlantVillage | 1,192 |
| **Corn (Maize)** | Northern Leaf Blight | Raw PlantVillage | 985 |
| **Corn (Maize)** | Healthy | Raw PlantVillage | 1,162 |
| **Rice** | Bacterial Leaf Blight | Kaggle Rice Leaf AUG | 636 |
| **Rice** | Brown Spot | Kaggle Rice Leaf AUG | 646 |
| **Rice** | Leaf Blast | Kaggle Rice Leaf AUG | 634 |
| **Rice** | Leaf Scald | Kaggle Rice Leaf AUG | 628 |
| **Rice** | Sheath Blight | Kaggle Rice Leaf AUG | 632 |
| **Rice** | Healthy Rice Leaf | Kaggle Rice Leaf AUG | 653 |

## 🏗️ Architecture & Methodology

### 1. CNN Model Design (`ScratchCropCNN`)
- **Input:** `224 × 224 × 3` RGB
- **Conv Blocks (4):** Filter progression `32 → 64 → 128 → 256`
  - Each block: `Conv2d (3×3, stride 1, pad 1)` → `BatchNorm2d` → `ReLU` → `MaxPool2d (2×2, stride 2)`
- **Spatial Reduction:** `224 × 224` → `112 × 112` → `56 × 56` → `28 × 28` → `14 × 14`
- **Classifier Head:** `AdaptiveAvgPool2d (GAP)` → `Dropout (p=0.5)` → `Linear (256, 10)`

### 2. Leakage-Proof Preprocessing & Split
- **Perceptual Deduplication:** Image hashing (`imagehash.phash`, distance threshold = 5) clusters near-duplicate images within each class.
- **Group-Aware Stratified Split:** 70% Train, 15% Validation, 15% Test. All members of near-duplicate clusters are kept strictly in the same split to avoid data leakage.
- **Dataset-Specific Normalization:** RGB channel mean and standard deviation are calculated strictly from the training partition:
  - `Mean: [0.4093, 0.5035, 0.3134]`
  - `Std:  [0.2068, 0.2053, 0.2021]`
- **Augmentation (Train split only):** Random Horizontal Flip ($p=0.5$), Random Rotation ($\pm 20^\circ$), Random Resized Crop (scale $0.8 - 1.0$). Photometric distortion is excluded to preserve disease color signals.

### 3. Optimization & Training Routine
- **Loss:** Class-weighted `CrossEntropyLoss` (mitigates mild 2.4:1 class imbalance).
- **Optimizer:** `Adam` (Initial Learning Rate = `1e-3`, $\beta_1=0.9, \beta_2=0.999$).
- **LR Scheduler:** `ReduceLROnPlateau` (factor = 0.5, patience = 3).
- **Early Stopping:** Monitored on validation loss (patience = 8).

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Condition Mismatch:** Corn images were captured under controlled lab backdrops (PlantVillage), whereas rice images have semi-field backgrounds.
2. **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Fallback:** Softmax probability thresholds detect inter-class confusion but do not naturally reject arbitrary non-plant imagery. An input validation filter is recommended for field use.
3. **Symptom Severity:** The model classifies categorical presence/absence, not disease progression or percentage severity.
